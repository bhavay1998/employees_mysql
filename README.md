## About the database
The script used to develop the <i>employees</i> database is "employees_db_creation.sql". Fusheng Wang's & Carlo Zaniolo's (2005) research on XML databases focused on publishing relational data as XML. Their work was meant to show that database histories could be efficiently queried using XML. The original data for the <i>employees</i> database came out of their research:<br>

The employees sample database was converted from XML into a relational form by Patrick Crews and Giuseppe Maxia:
