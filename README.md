## About the database
The script used to develop the <i>employees</i> database is ```employees_db_creation.sql```. The dataset originated from academic research by Fusheng Wang and Carlo Zaniolo (2005), which focused on representing and querying historical database data using XML:

The sample data was later adapted for broader use, and the XML-based dataset was converted into a relational schema by Patrick Crews and Giuseppe Maxia:
