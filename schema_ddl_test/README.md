# Schema - DDL Test
This folder contains files for a newly generated 'sales' database in MySQL. This database is only a sample database, and is NOT the primary database used to conduct analysis. The purpose of creating a sample database is to test the key elements of the <i> Data Definition Language (DDL). </i>

## Folder Files
- The relationship schema can be found in the "sample_db_schema.jpg" image file.
- The "Creating_a_database.sql" file contains the actual code used to prepare the database and test-out DDL.
